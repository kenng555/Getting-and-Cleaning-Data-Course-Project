Feature Selection 
=================

The features selected for this database come from the accelerometer and gyroscope 3-axial raw signals tAcc-XYZ and tGyro-XYZ. These time domain signals (prefix 't' to denote time) were captured at a constant rate of 50 Hz. Then they were filtered using a median filter and a 3rd order low pass Butterworth filter with a corner frequency of 20 Hz to remove noise. Similarly, the acceleration signal was then separated into body and gravity acceleration signals (tBodyAcc-XYZ and tGravityAcc-XYZ) using another low pass Butterworth filter with a corner frequency of 0.3 Hz. 

Subsequently, the body linear acceleration and angular velocity were derived in time to obtain Jerk signals (tBodyAccJerk-XYZ and tBodyGyroJerk-XYZ). Also the magnitude of these three-dimensional signals were calculated using the Euclidean norm (tBodyAccMag, tGravityAccMag, tBodyAccJerkMag, tBodyGyroMag, tBodyGyroJerkMag). 

Finally a Fast Fourier Transform (FFT) was applied to some of these signals producing fBodyAcc-XYZ, fBodyAccJerk-XYZ, fBodyGyro-XYZ, fBodyAccJerkMag, fBodyGyroMag, fBodyGyroJerkMag. (Note the 'f' to indicate frequency domain signals). 

These signals were used to estimate variables of the feature vector for each pattern:  
'-XYZ' is used to denote 3-axial signals in the X, Y and Z directions.

The output of script run_analysis.R contains two files/data sets for the Test and Train data set.

These two output data set contain the same columns summarising the 3-axial raw signals tAcc-XYZ and tGyro-XYZ readings captured by the cell phone's accelerometer and gyroscope.
Average was calculated for the means and std deviations of the x-y-z measurements grouped by Subject and Activity.

The colums/variables for each resulting data set are as follow:

1. Subject - Denoted the subject that performed the tested/training to which the data were 
   captured for.
2. Activity Code - The code corresponds to the activity performed
3. Activity Name - The new of the activity performed
4. tBodyAcc-mean()-X - the Average of the original measurement variable tBodyAcc-mean()-X grouped 
                       by Subject and Activity Code	
5. tBodyAcc-mean()-Y - the Average of the original measurement variable tBodyAcc-mean()-Y grouped 
                       by Subject and Activity Code	
6. tBodyAcc-mean()-Z - the Average of the original measurement variable tBodyAcc-mean()-Z grouped 
                      by Subject and Activity Code	
7. tBodyAcc-std()-X - the Average of the original measurement variable tBodyAcc-std()-X grouped 
                      by Subject and Activity Code	
8. tBodyAcc-std()-Y - the Average of the original measurement variable tBodyAcc-std()-Y grouped 
                      by Subject and Activity Code	
9. tBodyAcc-std()-Z - the Average of the original measurement variable tBodyAcc-std()-Z grouped 
                      by Subject and Activity Code
