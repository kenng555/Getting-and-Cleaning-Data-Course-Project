The output of script run_analysis.R contains two files/data sets for the Test and Train data set.

These two output data set contain the same columns summarising the readings captured by the cell 
phone's accelerometer and gyroscope.

The colums/variables for each resulting data set are as follow:

1. Subject - Denoted the subject that performed the tested/training to which the data were 
   captured for.
2. Activity Code - The code corresponds to the activity performed
3. Activity Name - The new of the activity performed
4. tBodyAcc-mean()-X - the Average of the original measurement variable tBodyAcc-mean()-X grouped 
                       by Subject and Activity Code	
5. tBodyAcc-mean()-Y - the Average of the original measurement variable tBodyAcc-mean()-Y grouped 
                       by Subject and Activity Code	
6. tBodyAcc-mean()-Z - the Average of the original measurement variable tBodyAcc-mean()-Z grouped 
                      by Subject and Activity Code	
7. tBodyAcc-std()-X - the Average of the original measurement variable tBodyAcc-std()-X grouped 
                      by Subject and Activity Code	
8. tBodyAcc-std()-Y - the Average of the original measurement variable tBodyAcc-std()-Y grouped 
                      by Subject and Activity Code	
9. tBodyAcc-std()-Z - the Average of the original measurement variable tBodyAcc-std()-Z grouped 
                      by Subject and Activity Code
