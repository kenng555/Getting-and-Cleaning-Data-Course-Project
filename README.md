Getting-and-Cleaning-Data-Course-Project
========================================
This repo contains an R script named "run_analysis.R".  This script will read in two sets of data related to Human Activities captured using the accelerometer and gyroscope inside a smart phone carried by the participant.  The original data set was randomly separated into two set where 70% of the volunteers was selected for generating the training data and 30% the test data.

The script will produce two tidy data sets that summarized the test and the training dataset respectively.  Each data set summarize and determine the mean of each variable for each unique combination of Subject and Activity.
